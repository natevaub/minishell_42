To Do List! :D

PARSING
-> Support Heredoc
-> Support syntax
	: segfault when syntax isn't correct ✅

EXECUTION
-> Support full path command: /bin/ls ✅

SIGNAL
-> Support signals:
	: buggy output when wc + Ctrl C ✅
	: need to test if ctrl + \ gives "Quit: 3" when interrupting a process

ERROR MANAGEMENT
-> Open pipe:
	: currently we have this:
		~/Desktop/minishell_team$ ls |
		minishell : syntax error near unexpected token `|'
	it should not give an error but wait for further input:
		bash-3.2$ ls |
		>
-> cat | cat | ls:
	: should show ls and then wait for further input

-> buffer management
